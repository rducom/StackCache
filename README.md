# StackCache
![](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9h4y9ttd1579d2e4?svg=true)

StackCache is a 3 level cache store framework (memory / distributed / database) 
to let devs quickly and safely scale any app.

### Stacked caches :
 - Local : ConcurrentDictionary (MemoryCache soon)
 - Distributed : Redis (SQL Server soon)
 - Database : Any database / ORM you want

### Current status : 

StackCache development just started, so it's at an early APLHA state.
Don't use this in production !
